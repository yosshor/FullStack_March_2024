For your next assignment, add a second screen to your existing app. This new screen should simulate a WhatsApp chat interface. Design it to display messages between users, similar to what you see when you open a conversation in WhatsApp. Include elements such as:

A header with contact/group name
A message area showing conversation bubbles
A text input field at the bottom
Send button

Make sure the design clearly shows how messages would appear for both the sender and recipient."
