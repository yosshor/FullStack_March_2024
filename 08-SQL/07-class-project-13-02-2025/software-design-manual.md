## Business Analysis

### Objective
Document and analyze business requirements, stakeholders, and operational context.

### Process
1. Schedule stakeholder interviews
2. Gather existing documentation
3. Analyze current systems
4. Document business goals
5. Identify constraints and limitations

### Key Questions
- What problem does the software solve?
- Who are the primary stakeholders?
- What are the business objectives?
- What are current pain points?
- What are regulatory requirements?
- What are success metrics?

```

## Version Control

### Branching Strategy
1. main/master - production code
2. develop - development branch
3. feature/* - feature branches
4. hotfix/* - urgent fixes
5. release/* - release preparation

### Documentation Guidelines
1. Use meaningful commit messages
2. Reference issue numbers
3. Keep commits atomic
4. Document breaking changes

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Organization
1. Follow consistent project structure
2. Use design patterns appropriately
3. Implement separation of concerns
4. Write unit tests

### Best Practices
1. Write clean, maintainable code
2. Follow SOLID principles
3. Document public APIs
4. Handle errors appropriately
5. Log important events
6. Implement security measures
