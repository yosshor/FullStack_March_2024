                <div class="article--quote"><b>Mercury records</b></div>
                <div class="article--information">When Republic Records offered Tyler Arnold a full-time assistant role five months into
                     his six-month internship with the label in 2014, taking it was “a no-brainer” — even if it meant dropping out of Northeastern 
                     University one year before graduating. “This is my dream,” Arnold recalls thinking. “I have to go for it.”
                    Arnold quickly became an A&R executive extraordinaire: His first signing to the label, in 2015, was a young Post Malone 
                    (“I signed him on my 23rd birthday,” Arnold recalls); his second was superproducer Metro Boomin in late 2016. By 2020, 
                    Arnold was Republic’s executive vp of A&R. “I really loved discovering music in high school and college, finding new artists
                     and seeing them grow,” he says. “I also wanted to work really closely with the artists, and I felt like A&R, if you do it right, 
                     there’s such a personal connection that you can build.”
                    Today, the fast-rising executive is applying that same mentality as president of Mercury Records, the Republic division that 
                    relaunched in April 2022 with major names like Post and Noah Kahan and strategic partnerships with Big Loud (Morgan Wallen) and 
                    Imperial Music (Bo Burnham). And though Arnold says he wasn’t sure he was ready to head a label, “I wanted to grow as an executive.”</div>

                 <p>Nominations for Billboard’s executive lists open no less than 150 days in advance of publication, and a link 
                 is sent to press representatives by request before the nomination period. (Please email thom.duffy@billboard.com 
                 for inclusion on the email list for nomination links and to obtain an editorial calendar.) Billboard’s 40 Under 40
                  list was chosen by editors from selected industry sectors, based on factors including, but not limited to, nominations 
                  by peers, colleagues and superiors. In addition to information requested with nominations, editors consider industry
                   impact as measured by metrics including, but not limited to, chart, sales and streaming performance as measured by
                    Luminate and social media impressions using data available as of April 2.</p></div>
