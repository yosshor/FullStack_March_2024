# Home Puzzle: Enhancing Your Team Project

## Background
For this home puzzle, you'll be working with the previous project completed by your team. We'll be adding new features to improve functionality and user experience.

## Level 1: Admin Page and Item Addition
**Task:** Add an admin page with a form to add new items.

**Requirements:**
1. Create a new admin page in your project.
2. If creating a new page is challenging, you may add the form to the existing store page.
3. The form should allow input of relevant item details (e.g., name, price, quantity).
4. Implement functionality to add the new item to your existing item list or database.

## Level 2: Admin Item Management
**Task:** Enhance the admin page with item management features.

**Requirements:**
1. Create a list view of all items on the admin page.
2. Implement a delete function for each item.
3. Add the ability to change the quantity of each item.
4. Allow updating the name of each item.
5. Ensure all changes are reflected in your item list or database.

## Level 3: Data Persistence with LocalStorage
**Task:** Implement data persistence using localStorage.

**Requirements:**
1. Use localStorage to save your item data.
2. Implement functionality to load data from localStorage when the page reloads.
3. Ensure that all changes (additions, deletions, updates) are saved to localStorage.
4. Test that your data persists across page reloads and browser restarts.

## Bonus Challenge
Implement error handling and validation for your forms to ensure data integrity.

**Note:** Remember to test your code thoroughly and document any assumptions or design decisions you make along the way. Good luck with your home puzzle!
