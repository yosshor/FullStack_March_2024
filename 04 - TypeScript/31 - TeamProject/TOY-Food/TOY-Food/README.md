# TOY-Food Project

Welcome to the TOY-Food project! The name "TOY-Food" is inspired by the first letters of our names, and it perfectly captures the playful and vibrant spirit we want to bring to our food ordering website. Let's create something fun, user-friendly, and memorable together!

## Project Vision

### The TOY-Food Concept
Our goal is to develop a lively and engaging food ordering website that stands out through its playful design and interactive elements. The "TOY" in our name reflects a sense of fun and creativity, which we’ll infuse into every aspect of the site. From a colorful design to interactive animations, TOY-Food will make ordering food an enjoyable experience, almost like playing a game!

### Design and Branding Ideas
- **Playful Design**: We'll use bright colors, cartoonish icons, and playful animations to create a friendly and inviting interface.
- **Interactive Elements**: Features like an animated toy-like shopping cart and sound effects can enhance user engagement.
- **Mascot and Logo**: We can develop a cute mascot to guide users through the site, and our logo will incorporate toy and food elements to reinforce our brand identity.
- **Slogan**: "TOY-Food – Easy as a game, tasty as a treat!" could be a catchy slogan that embodies our brand's playful yet delicious appeal.

## Project Structure and Tasks

### Tools and Technologies
We'll be using HTML, SCSS, TypeScript, and Vite as our build tool. Since we’re not working with servers yet, we'll use `localStorage` to simulate server functionality.

### MVC Structure and Task Distribution
We'll follow the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, which will help us organize our code and make collaboration easier. Here’s how we’ll break down the tasks:

#### Participant 1: **Frontend (HTML & SCSS)**
- **Task 1: Home Page**
  - Create the HTML structure for the home page.
  - Develop CSS styles for the slider, search form, and category cards.
- **Task 2: Food Catalog**
  - Layout the food catalog page, including filters and sorting options.
  - Develop responsive styles for the food item cards and other elements.
- **Task 3: Cart & Checkout**
  - Design the cart page where users can modify their orders.
  - Style the checkout page, including the form for user details.

#### Participant 2: **Frontend (TypeScript & localStorage)**
- **Task 1: Cart Logic**
  - Implement the logic for adding and removing items from the cart using `localStorage`.
  - Calculate and display the total order cost dynamically.
- **Task 2: Checkout Process**
  - Handle form data during checkout and store order information in `localStorage`.
  - Display a confirmation message after a successful order.
- **Task 3: User Authentication & Profile**
  - Implement user registration and login using `localStorage`.
  - Manage user profiles and order history within `localStorage`.

#### Participant 3: **Content Management (localStorage)**
- **Task 1: Managing Food Items & Categories**
  - Script the storage and retrieval of food items and categories from `localStorage`.
  - Implement filtering and sorting of food items based on data from `localStorage`.
- **Task 2: Order Management**
  - Store and manage order information in `localStorage`.
  - Update order statuses and display them in the user profile.
- **Task 3: Simplified Admin Panel**
  - Create functionality to add, edit, and delete food items and categories using `localStorage`.

### Next Steps
We'll divide the tasks as discussed and regularly check in to ensure we’re on track. With teamwork and creativity, we’ll make TOY-Food a fun and successful project!

## TOY-Food Figma Design

To help visualize and streamline the interface of our project, I adapted an existing design in Figma to suit our restaurant's needs.
