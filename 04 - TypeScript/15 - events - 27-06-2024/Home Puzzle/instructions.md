Game Idea: Click to Make Things Disappear, Explode, and Move

use a map in the background.

Use the MVC pattern to separate the game logic from the rendering.

# Level 1: Click to Disappear

Make a Creature: It shows up on the screen.
Click it: The creature disappears!

# Level 2: Explosions!

Click a Creature: It disappears AND...
BOOM! An explosion happens where it was.

# Level 3: Creatures roam around

Creatures Appear: They start wandering around randomly.
Click to Disappear: Click them, and they disappear with an explosion.
Keep Changing: Every few seconds, creatures pick a new direction to wander in.

# Level 4: As time goes by...
Creators move faster and faster.
The player can see a score board with the number of creatures that have been clicked. 
She gets points for each creature clicked. the faster thy move, the more points she gets.

# Level 5: The player can choose the number of creatures that appear on the screen.
Make a menu that lets the player choose the number of creatures that appear on the screen.

Good luck!
