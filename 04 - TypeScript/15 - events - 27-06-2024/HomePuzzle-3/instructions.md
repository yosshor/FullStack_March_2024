In this exercise, you will create a list of cards representing different types of pets on the DOM. Each card will correspond to a specific type of pet, such as dogs, cats, parrots, or any other domestic animal. Additionally, you will create buttons for each type of pet to filter the displayed cards.

### Instructions

1. Create an HTML file and link a SCSS file to it.
2. Inside the HTML file, create a container element to hold the pet cards.
3. In the CSS file, style the container element to display the cards in a grid layout.
4. Create a TypeScript file and link it to the HTML file.
5. In the TypeScript file, define an array of objects, where each object represents a type of pet. Each object should have properties such as name, image URL, and description.
6. Use TypeScript to dynamically generate the pet cards based on the array of objects. Each card should display the pet's name, image, price and description.
7. Append the generated cards to the container element in the HTML file.


8. Create buttons for each type of pet. When a button is clicked, filter the displayed cards to show only the cards corresponding to the selected pet type.
9. Create a button to show all pet cards when clicked.
10. (optional) add a button to sort the cards by price (starting at the lowest price).

Remember to test your code and make any necessary *adjustments* to ensure the desired functionality.
