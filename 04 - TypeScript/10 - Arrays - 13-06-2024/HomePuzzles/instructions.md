# Array Reversal:

Write a function reverseArray<T>(arr: T[]): T[] that takes an array of any type and returns a new array with the elements in reversed order.
Example: reverseArray([1, 2, 3]) should return [3, 2, 1].

# Array Summation:

Write a function sumArray(arr: number[]): number that takes an array of numbers and returns their sum.

# Maximum Element:

Write a function findMax(arr: number[]): number that takes an array of numbers and returns the largest number.
Handle the case of an empty array appropriately (e.g., return undefined or throw an error).

# Filtering Even Numbers:

Write a function filterEven(arr: number[]): number[] that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array containing only the even numbers.

# Unique Values:

Write a function unique(arr: SomeType[]): SomeType[] that takes an array of any type and returns a new array with only unique elements.

# Frequency Counter:
Print the elements of an array in the decreasing frequency if 2 numbers have the same frequency then print the one which came first

Examples:  

Input:  arr[] = [2, 2,2, 8, 5, 6, 8, 8, 8]
Output: arr[] = [8, 2, 5,  6] // 8 came 4 times 2 came 2 times 5 came 1 time 6 came 1 time

Hint: write another function that counts instances of a number in an array, and use it.
