If the person is under 18 years old, they get a 50% discount.
If the person is between 18 and 67 (inclusive), they pay the full ticket price.
If the person is over 67 years old,


# Sum of Odd Numbers Function:

Write a TypeScript function named sumOfOddNumbers that takes a positive integer n as input and returns the sum of all odd numbers from 1 up to n (inclusive). Use a loop and a conditional statement to achieve this.

Example:

If n = 5, the function should return 9 (1 + 3 + 5 = 9).
If n = 8, 


# FizzBuzz Function:

Write a TypeScript function named fizzBuzz that takes a number n as input.
The function should print numbers from 1 to n, but with the following replacements:
If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz".
If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz".
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
Use a for loop and conditional statements (if, else if, else) to implement the logic.



# Prime Number Checker:
(This question is rather demanding)

Create a function called isPrime that takes a number num as input.
The function should return true if num is a prime number, and false otherwise.
Use a for loop and appropriate conditions to determine if a number is prime.
