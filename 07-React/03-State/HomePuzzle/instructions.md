# Building Interactive Web Applications with APIs
Exercise Instructions

## Level 1: Random Food Image Display (90 points max)
Create a web application that displays random food images using the [Foodish API](https://foodish-api.com/api/). The app should fetch and show a different food image each time it loads.

## Level 2: API Data Display (95 points max)
Browse the [Public APIs List](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) and select an API of your choice. Create an application that displays a list of items from your selected API. Focus on presenting the data in a card-based layout. Make it visually appealing using SCSS.

## Level 3: Interactive Image Refresh (100 points max)
Enhance your solution from task 2 by adding a refresh button to each card. When clicked, this button should fetch and display a new random image for that specific card while maintaining all other card information.
