# Lifting State Up

- **Lifting State Up** is a technique in React to move the state from a child component to the parent component. This is done by creating a state in the parent component and passing it down to the child component as props.
- This technique is useful when two or more components need to share the same state. By lifting the state up, the parent component can manage the state and pass it down to the child components as props.
- **Lifting State Up** is a common pattern in React applications. It helps to keep the state in a single place and makes the code more maintainable and easier to understand.
