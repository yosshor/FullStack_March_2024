# Class puzzle

## Instructions
Create a React application that demonstrates component hierarchy and state management. The application should find the highest number among user inputs. Here's the required structure:
Create an App component that serves as the main container. Within this App component, implement two types of child components:

- Four identical ```<Input />``` components where users can enter numbers. Each Input component should use the Input UI component from your component library to maintain consistent styling.
- One ```<Output />``` component that will display the highest number among all the values entered in the Input components.

The App component should manage the state of all numbers and pass the necessary data and functions to its child components. This structure demonstrates proper component composition and data flow in React, with the parent App component coordinating between the input and output features.
